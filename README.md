# Data Mining and Machine Learning Coursework

## Description
This repository contains a portfolio of various data mining and machine learning algorithms that I learned in my F21DL class at university.

The Bayes net notebook uses the wine quality dataset. For the remaining alorithms, I needed a more challenging dataset and so I switched to the Kuzushiji-49 dataset, which is similar to MNIST but for old Japanese characters.

I have also included a .yml file if you wish to replicate my environment using conda.

## Access Rights
Everyone is free to view, download and edit these notebooks as they see fit.

## Remarks
Special thanks to Daniel for mentoring me. The suggestions and criticisms made for a great feedback that helped me significantly in developing this portfolio.
